	**Potential to allow level creators to define own world limits
-Camera now automatically stops panning at edge of world

--FIXES
-Fixed crash if trying to open debug menu in main menu
-Fixed collisions occasionally not being cleaned up
-Fixed incorrect collision responses on spike blocks facing upward
-Fixed jumping/front-flipping right after crouching causing player to fall out of bounds
-Fixed player crouching not being instantaneous, no longer tied to gravity

--KNOWN ISSUES
*Editor cannot select blocks when dragging right to left, or bottom to top
*OpenGL issue is still present in certain cases(Walking to left)
*Objects currently don't utilize spritebatches
*Enemy collisions can cause player to fall out of bounds..maybe try rearranging world:move and update
*Certain buttons have cutoff textures
*Block rendered needs to be further optimized
	*Stop checking for intersecting(SLOW)
	*Stop looping through blocks twice for highlighting
	*When editing a level, FPS goes from 650->330(Draw tool tanks frames)
	*Slowdown when holding LMB with any tool selected
